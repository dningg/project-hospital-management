# HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## Overview
This project is a Hospital Management System implemented in C++. It allows users to manage and store information about doctors and nurses working at a hospital. Users can add, view, edit, and search staff information. The system calculates the total salary of all staff based on specific criteria for each role (doctor or nurse).

## Features
1. **Add Staff Information**: Users can add information about doctors and nurses to the system. They need to provide details such as staff name, staff ID, date of birth, time of starting work, phone number, and department.

2. **View Staff List**: Users can view the list of doctors, the list of nurses, or the combined list of all staff members. The system displays the information for each staff member, including their name, ID, date of birth, time of starting work, phone number, department, and position (doctor/nurse). The monthly salary of each staff member is also shown.

3. **Edit Staff Information**: Users can edit the information of a staff member. They can choose which field to edit, such as staff name, staff ID, date of birth, time of starting work, phone number, department, number of working days (for doctors), or number of night shifts (for nurses).

4. **Search Staff Information**: Users can search for staff members based on different criteria, such as staff name, staff ID, date of birth, time of starting work, phone number, or department. The system will display the matching staff members' information.

5. **Calculate Total Salary**: The system calculates and displays the total salary for all staff members. The salary is computed based on specific formulas for doctors and nurses.

## How to Use

2. Choose options from the main menu to perform specific actions, such as adding staff information, viewing staff lists, editing staff information, searching for staff, calculating total salary, or exiting the program.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input and manage staff information.

## Dependencies
